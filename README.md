A practice project for a hotel management site to track the arrival and departure of anyone who has booked a room, what amenities they have requested, and...

In this project, I worked with many important React libraries.
Such as the following libraries:

- styled-components
- react-router
- Redux/Redux Toolkit
- @supabase/supabase-js
- @tanstack/react-query
- date-fns
- react-error-boundary
- react-hook-form
- react-hot-toast
- react-icons
- recharts
